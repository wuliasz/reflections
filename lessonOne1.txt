How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    	it showed them right near each other.   
	no need to switch between files to check. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	fast, easy access to specific changes and when they occurred. 
	

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	pro:  you can test changes and wait until they're correct before committing
		you can wait until whatever you're doing is complete. 
		(like not saving in between a sentence)
	con: 	if you're doing something big, and forget, then you end up 
		with a big commit. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	because git was designed for software developers;
	google just want's all your personal information to get rich.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 	by executing them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    
	less chance of losing important changes because you can step back through versions
