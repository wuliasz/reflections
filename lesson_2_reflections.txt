What happens when you initialize a repository? 

you set up the metadata part of git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

different from working directory because it's like a repository: 
it's tracked
different from a repository, because it doesn't ahve a head?
that is, it's temporary(?) in transition(?)

offers another chance to catch issues before committing changes.
